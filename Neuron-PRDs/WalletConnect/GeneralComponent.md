#### 1.1.3 Status2: Connecting

To do so, users are always supposed to click a scan button, and if the QR code is correct then the dapp and wallet are trying to communicate following the protocol. If the QR code is not in correct format, corresponding messages will be popped up.

#### 1.1.4 Status3: Connect Request

Once the WalletConnection information fecthes back, the wallet shows the connection request information, including the dapp name, its url, network, Account and Auth.

- The network refers to the CKB network to which the dapp is going to connect.
- The Account refers to the CKB wallet account that the user is going to use.
- The Auth refers to the lock method for user addresses. Typically, a user's addresses can be divided into different adress sets based on the lock method they use, and here various classification methods are provided. dapps can request the specific address sets they need, and users can choose to revoke authorization for certain address sets.

To cancel this request, just press the Reject button.
