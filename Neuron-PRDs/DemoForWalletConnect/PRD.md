# A process and a dataflow of how Neuron/JoyID work with this protocol
In order to locate and describe the Account issue we may face while using this protocol, A process and dataflow of how Neuron/JoyID work with this protocol is considered a case to talk with.

To solve this problem, a Dapp demo and its UX protocol will be proposed below to demonstrate how the dapp communicates with wallet by this protocol.
